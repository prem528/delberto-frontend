            Delberto aims to empower artisans, crafters, aspiring entrepreneurs
            (individuals, students, retired professionals), small businesses, and marginalized communities through
            our SaaS-based technology platform. Our goal is to facilitate entrepreneurship by connecting suppliers
            with sellers, regardless of their prior entrepreneurial or e-commerce experience, and eliminating
            upfront costs. We provide advanced tools for business growth, customization options, streamlined
            logistics, and global payment integrations.
